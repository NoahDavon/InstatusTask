Hello, Instatus!
Please excuse the horrible display of hacky coding in this repo. 
I was in a hurry, and I had quite a few technologies to learn/relearn/refresh during this task. 

So, what could I have done better? 
Well, the filters should've been a drop down, but I figured you already know I can do that so I went the lazy route. 
The architecture is HORRIBLE. It started with me postponing some refactoring and ended up with very messy code that I'd take at least a day to refactor. You know what they say about procrastination.. 
The POST route needed more love, but I figured this was mainly a front-end task and that I was fine-ish. 
The metadata was treated as an unknown variable so I just stringified it and tossed it in there. 

All in all, that was messy and hacky, but I hope it was a display of my strong points and my quick learning, and I hope you understand where and why I chose to deliberately cut corners. 

I've never used Prisma or SWR, 
I've not used SQL in years, 
I didn't know Vercel offered Postgres and wasted so much time looking for a provider. 
Yep, that's all the disclaimers I have! Enjoy!
I would like to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this task. Took me a weekend, more or less, but it was fun. Thanks! And thanks for considering me!
